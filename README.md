# Approach Taken

Here I have used Spring boot framework to work on the Project. The IDE used is eclipse. I have used Thymeleaf which is a java template engine for processing and creating HTML, XML, JavaScript, CSS and text. I have also used H2 as in memory database. I have divided the project into two parts 1) Users and 2) Todo Tasks. There can be multiple users who can have multiple tasks. For Security I have used BCryptPasswordEncoder, which saves the variable in an encrypted format. So In this project, the password will be encypted and saved in the in memory data base table.


# Design Patterns

Here I have used builder Design Pattern to divide the problem set in to sub problems using interfaces.



# Time Constraint

Due to lack of time, I was unable to write junit test cases. If given more time I would have written junit cases as well as I would have added admin user who can view all the tasks of all users.
